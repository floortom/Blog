## My Microblog Project

I built a simple microblog to document everything I’m learning—by the end, I’ll have a personal timeline filled with useful notes and reflections.

### 🚀 What You’ll See
- **Header** with “Recent” and “Calendar” navigation.  
- **New Entry Form** to quickly jot down thoughts, code snippets, or resources.  
- **Entry Feed** showing all the posts I’ve created, in reverse chronological order.  
- **Footer** with links and a little info about me, the developer!

### 🎯 What I Learned
1. **Software Development Workflow**  
   - Applied incremental (Agile-inspired) development: breaking the project into manageable milestones, staying flexible, and iterating as I go.  
2. **Design & Usability Principles**  
   - Thought through layout, typography, and responsive design so my microblog looks great on every device.  
3. **Advanced HTML & CSS**  
   - Reinforced core skills and picked up new techniques (flexbox, grid, forms, and custom components) to build a polished UI.  
4. **Flask & Backend Integration**  
   - Set up a Python/Flask server to handle form submissions, routing, and database connections—so every entry is stored permanently.  

### 🛠️ Running Locally
With your virtual environment activated, run the following in your console:

```powershell
$env:FLASK_APP = "app.py"
$env:FLASK_DEBUG = 1
flask run
